Heal | Kill

("|" stands for the binary operator "or" so read it "Heal or Kill")

is the first game I made (it's not quite right, in fact, I made a lot of prototypes before, but the first one I finished was "Heal | Kill".

-------------

I made it when I was 16 years old, for the itch.io game jam "[Low Rez Jam](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016)" where the goal was to make a game with a maximum resolution of 64x64 pixels.

This was quite challenging, especially because I never really used unity before, but I really enjoyed doing it and I learnt a lot of things from this.

-------------

In this game you'll play as a wizard in a temple, and waves of characters will come from the right of your screen. 
You'll have to either kill them (if they're enemies) or heal them (if they're your friends).
Each action you take will increase or decrease your life bar.

Be careful, the spawning rate of enemies spawning will increase with time !
