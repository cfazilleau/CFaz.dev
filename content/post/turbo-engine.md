## Turbo Engine 
is a game engine developped as a student project by Clément Fazilleau, Basile Combet, Julien Soysouvanh and Gregoire Penon.

It is written in C++ and python.

## Our Choices

This Game Engine uses OpenGL for the rendering part and PhysX for the Physics part.
The Windowing is done using the library GLFW.
The Editor is acheived using the library Qt.

## Resources

All the assets used to make the game belongs to [Axel Daviot](https://www.artstation.com/dafty9), a friend of mine who kindly accepted to let me borrow his work.

## Rendering

The rendering allows us to use the following technologies:

- PBR
- particules
- materiaux
- hdr

## Scripting

The engine's DLL is separated from the game DLL.

- Scripting
- realtime compilation
- hot reload
- dll
- lua

## Editor

The Engine's Editor is made using Qt 5.13

- launcher
- undockable panels
- Multiple viewports
- Scenetree
- Gizmos
- Material editor
