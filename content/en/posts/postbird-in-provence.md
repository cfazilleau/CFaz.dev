# Postbird In Provence

is a Nintendo Switch Game created as a Graduation Project at ISART Digital Paris.

You will play as Marcel, who just arrived in montélimace, a french provencal village, to be the new postbird of the town.

⚠ Disclaimer: this video shows the state of the game in BETA stage (5 months into development) and a lot of assets / features are still to be implemented and polished by the team.

This game also takes advantage of the joycons and their "six-axis sensors" (3 linear axis + 3 angular axis) to inspect the packages and make interactions funnier.
